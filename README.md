##Hunter's Line Editor
I made this program as a very simple line editor for BASIC programs. It should be cross platform but I have not tested it at all on anything other than my machine.
To use it, call the program followed by a text file name. This program is in its very early stages and comes with no warranty.
<br/>
I still have not tested it much but it should work for some very simple tasks. I'd avoid using it on import files until it is more stable.
<br/>
For pretty much all commands, run the program and type "help".
